We all love to show our successes, don't we? And we should. But failures are a necessary part of any human life. Let me tell you about just a few of my **failures**:

  - **I quite music school** as a kid. I was too shy for performances.

  - I applied for Design School. **I was rejected**.

  - **I suck at baking**. My cakes look like something that a baby dropped on the floor.

  - **I suck at sports**. I was always the slow one.

But failures are not eternal spots on our souls! Lets see what I did about them:

  - Starting with drama club in elementary school, I faced my fear of performance. Now I LOVE it! I have great experiences with teaching, presentations, and even performing in a dance production!

  - Somebody decided not to select me for design school. Now I am I self-taught artist, doing drawing, photography, 3D modeling, video editing etc. I even won art competitions!

  - Sucking at baking never stopped me from making birthday cakes for my friends! At first, those poor creations of mine were like ugly saint comedians - nasty to look at, good on the inside and making everybody laugh. But now I can even make them look good!

  - I found a sport that fit me. I found rowing, even won a few medals and became the president of our rowing sport club.

These are just a few failures of mine but I have and I will have plenty more of them. I learn and I will learn from them. If we ever meet, I would love to tell you more and would also love to hear about yours!
