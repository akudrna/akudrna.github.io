I am currently a graduate student finishing Masters at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Zagreb in Croatia, majoring:

  - Philosophy (teaching course)
  - Social Humanistic Informatics (scientific course)

I love learning and challenges, so I am professionally oriented towards multiple fields:

  - philosophy (esp. bioethics)
  - teaching and e-learning
  - social humanistic informatics
  - management
  - marketing

I also like to do drawing, photography, photo manipulation, 3D sculpting, video production, sports and other things.

I appreciate intrinsic motivation, intellectual curiosity, scientific reasoning, creative persistence and application of interdisciplinary knowledge!
